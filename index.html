    <h1>A Comparison of Interface Designs</h1>
    <h3><i>Fractal Fantasy: Liquid Entropy</i> by Mika Chernov & Sinjin Hawke and <i>7 Poems</i> by Justine Nguyen-Nguyen</h3>

        <p>
            The interface design of Mika Chernov and Sinjin Hawke’s website <i>‘Fractal Fantasy: Liquid Entropy’</i> is unconventional in its way of guiding the user. Rather than using text to guide, it favours a minimalistic control panel that allows the user to experiment creatively, giving them the creative reins. The minimal control panel of clearly labelled sliders occupies a small portion of the screen, which intentionally directs the user’s attention to the “canvas”, inviting exploration without the creators dictating the results. <i>‘7 Poems’</i>  by Justine Nguyen-Nguyen on the other hand is more explicit with their navigation.  The layout relies more on text and uses a generous amount of whitespace to separate the 7 poems, allowing the user to navigate the design easier as they focus on the vertical lines (Gerlinger 2022). There is symmetry and alignment to Justine’s design, and the lack of hierarchy conveys that all the poems hold equal importance. The symmetrical layout communicates stability (Milosevic 2025), grounding the user even as words are swiftly changing from each card.

        <h4>Mapping</h4>

        <p>
            The navigation in <i>‘Liquid Entropy’</i> is a chaotic, somewhat 3D environment where sound and visuals blend to create an immersive experience for the user. Mouse movements cause metallic swirls and ripples, its size and intensity can be manipulated by the control sliders. There’s no defined path or progression, instead, the interface becomes personalised to the user and is a constantly changing map of audiovisual chaos. By contrast, <i>'7 Poems'</i> has a type of grid system: 2 on the top row, 3 in the middle, and 2 at the bottom, which maps its vertical bars to the corresponding poems. When you click a bar, it expands to a rectangular card and clicking it again will pause it. It is very straightforward in its approach. Justine doesn’t want to overcomplicate the user experience, and there’s less creative freedom in their design.

        <h4>Characterisation</h4>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>
            The design of <i>‘Liquid Entropy’</i> is dynamic through its visuals and responsive sound design. The utilisation of the grey metallics implies that the creators may not want to assert themselves into the user’s creativity. Greys carry a neutral and soothing energy, and according to Brainchild Studios (n.d.) they evoke calmness and stillness, they are not an assertive or forceful energy. The ripples, waves, and distortions in the interface make it feel like its alive and responsive to the user. Every action the user takes creates new particles and alters the soundscape; it reacts in real time. This characterisation reinforces the experience that the creators are trying to convey, they want the users to have creative freedom while also experiencing chaos and randomness. In <i>‘7 Poems’</i>, the characterisation is more stable, less chaotic. Justine chose to use a muted yellow background for their design, yellow is considered a complex colour that not only invokes feelings of joy, but also aggression and irritation depending on the intensity (Cherry 2023). Justine also incorporated greens which in colour psychology, is said to evoke a sense of balance and calmness (Strathmore 2020). The muted yellow colour background and complementary green fosters a clam and intimate atmosphere. The rapid flashes of words are synchronised to a musical note, making the poems into instruments. The lacky of flashy animations, and instead simple typography and music conveys an intimate yet experimental atmosphere.

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>
            The feedback in <i>‘Liquid Entropy’</i> is immediately responsive to the user, a continuous and a multisensory experience. By adjusting the sliders, the visuals can have stronger warps to them. Hovering over the screen creates softer sounds and visuals while movement unleashes more waves and sounds. The audio-visuals synchronising to the movements of the user reinforces the themes of creative freedom, as well as disorder. With <i>‘7 Poems’</i>, feedback is concise and more easily understandable. When you click a poem bar, the bar stretches into a larger width rectangle, its background matches the page’s muted yellow, the poem’s words flash quickly as it progresses, each word is accompanied by a musical note. Clicking on the rectangle again will pause the word and the musical notes, the colour turns into a darker, solid green, indicating it is paused. This expresses simply to the users how their actions influence the UI. When all poems are opened, all the individual notes work together to create musical composition. The user can experiment with the music, acting as orchestrators.

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>
            I believe <i>‘Liquid Entropy’</i> was meant to embody chaos, as per the name. By minimising instructions, texts, and a rigid structure, the creators hand the user the reins, inviting them to freely explore and shape their own experience.  The use of reactive audiovisual design is a call for the user to experience “entropy”, to embrace the disorder and discover its beauty. The monochromatic metallic palette suggests both freedom and complexity. The interactive visual and sound design allows the user to become the architects of chaos.  
Justine Nguyen-Nguyen’s <i>‘7 Poems’</i> blends literature and music to create their experience. By using a simple layout, they grant immediate clarity to the users, encouraging them to engage with the poems. The layout feels orderly yet artistic, avoiding overwhelming complexity. Once a bar is clicked, the poems quickly flash in succession, each transition has their own note, transforming the UI into an abstract and percussive performance. Though its up to the user to layer the soundscape, the interaction is more rigid compared to <i>‘Liquid Entropy’</i>. The interaction between sound and text creates a sense of life in the poems. The message of this design may be that individual fragments may seem random or incomprehensible, but when together, can create a larger narrative.
